## ðŸ“„ Description

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for solving classic puzzles. It is part of an academic assignment for the course *AI Algorithms* (MESIIN476024).

The repository includes:

1. **Sliding Magic Square Puzzle**:
   - Problem formulation as a search problem.
   - Exploration of search space with Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Iterative Deepening Search (IDS).

2. **8-Puzzle Problem**:
   - Implementation of AI search algorithms:
     - Uniform Cost Search
     - A* Search with various heuristics
     - Best-First Search
   - Comparison of algorithm performance.
